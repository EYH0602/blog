# The American Dream

## ? 

*This is a discussion post during class after the discussion of the musical "Hamilton"*

Do you believe that the "American Dream" is accessible by all who come to this country?

## Ha

**No.**
This is a hard deny to what characterized the US.
Despite the negative connotation of the word "stereotype",
"American Dream" is a stereotype of the US since it does not really exist but everyone believes it:
an ideology, a system of belief.
The famous DREAM Act for immigrants and the DREAMers (immigrant who was affected) are the classic examples of "American Dream" and people who come to this country.
But instead of helping people achieve this American Dream, this bill would instead make a subset of undocumented youth vulnerable to deportation
[("The New Dream Act Holds Some Dreamers' Pasts Against Them.")](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/06/17/the-new-dream-act-holds-some-dreamers-pasts-against-them).
The hegemony political situation in the country leads to criminalization in the migrant community,
diving the community into "good He 3 immigrant" and "bad immigrant"
[(Schwiertz)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304718039_Transformations_of_the_undocumented_youth_movement_and_radical_egalitarian_citizenship).
Even charity (the support provided by the government or healthy people) is only offered to groups of people who meet the requirements under moral frameworks, including faithful, not alcoholic, or having children (Dean Spade "Solidarity is Not Charity").
Therefore I don't believe that the "American Dream" is accessible by all who come to this country.
