# Grave of the Fireflies

> A disagreement caused by the different viewing points.

If you do a search on any social media,
there will be arguments, or perhaps disagreements, toward this film.
However, the point of conflict is very distinct on the Chinese media (or "简中互联网") and the else.
Correspondingly, there are focused on whether the film's main idea is
anti-war v.s. "anti-defeated" or who killed Setsuko (the litter sister).

To me, although these two arguments looks very different,
their core reasoning are the same.
In the context of this film (and many other where debates took place),
the discussion is about how should Japanese talks about the history [1].
After viewing the film, we all agree that the author characterized the main characters as victim
under such tragedy.
The disagreement is always on "what causes the tragedy?"

As Goldberg argues, and I agrees, that
> I argue that, while the film presents a realistic picture of suffering, it is
> also critical of a blind patriotism that masks selfish impulses during the war
> and, afterward, of Japan’s inability to confront this past. 
> Seita, who is not only the author’s doppelganger of guilt, is also a figure who expresses selfishness
> masked by nationalistic fervor. When he, like others in the film, acts in
> the "name" of communal ideals, he is really performing for personal gain or
> pleasure.
the pursue of personal gain or pleasure over others is the main cause.
The film continuously highlight this quality of Seita,
when they move out from their aunt, never help with anything in the house, and selling from others, ...,
which should be a clear indication that Seita symbolizes and represents **nationalism**.
If the we can draw the conclusion that Seita's actions contributes the most towards his sister's death,
then the cause of the tragedy should be clear.

Another indication is that Seiko, though never join the Self-Defense Forces or the army,
always wears a uniform.
In fact, the uniform is one of the important things he run to get when running away from the fire at the beginning of the film.
As Goldberg quotes from McVeigh,
> History was often invoked to account for why Japanese
> wore uniforms: ‘the uniform system’ (seifuku seido) we see today is connected
> to the wartime period. A sense of comradeship (nakama ishiki) and group consciousness
> (minzoku ishiki).
The uniform in Japanese society,
so often seen today in the sailor and military suits of schoolchildren, is
a marker of group identity and solidarity. However, it is also a coded gesture
in order to force these individual members to comply with that group’s standards.
Uniforms represent the specified role of each individual,
made visible to the Foucauldian panopticon. In Seita’s case, as the normalizing
gaze is also his spirit’s gaze, his social role is as member of the fire brigade—a
function we never see him fulfill. As Grave was marketed as an educational experience
for Japanese schoolchildren, who likewise would be wearing school
“military” uniforms, the message would be unmistakable. They are asked to
see themselves in Seita.
