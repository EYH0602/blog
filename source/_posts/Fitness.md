# Tips On Fitness

The pandemic limited our ways of daily exercise and increased our will to eat unhealthily.
Although I did not get COVID, gaining weight also made some negative impact on my health,
including but not limited to
* trouble falling asleep
* reduced interest in may things
* less motivation to do anything
* feel tried easily
To help those suffering under the same symptom,
I put together some tips from my real experience in this blog post.

So when I got back to Beijing, I decided to start exercise regularly.
Here are some results:
* First stage: 101 kg to 80 kg (reduce weight is the main purpose)
* Second stage:: 80 kg to 70 kg (while gaining some muscle)

Some people may think regular exercise may take too much of their daily life,
this is just a bad excuse.
Actually, for me, the first stage happened during my internship at ByteDance,
working [10 am to 8 pm everyday](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU). 
The second stage was during the following fall quarter while taking 20 upper division units on math and cs.
If I can find time to exercise during those intense workloads,
so can you.

## Training

### First Stage

This may contradict to many people's believe, but I don't recommend long duration running,
especially when your body weight is high.
[HIIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) is the major thing to do.
* About 40-50 minutes a day, 6 days a week.
* Try different moves every, one cycle a week to make it interesting
* if time is allowed, 20 - 40 minutes of cardio after
  * I did Treadmill, high incline at low speed (fast walking but not running)
* hire a coach to correct your exercise moves, and may talk to when you get bored 

When you feel capable, add strength training.
I added strength training when I weighted around 85 kg
* 2 - 3 times a week, major on chest and legs
* I also changed the exercise on Sat to Muay Thai lesson.
* the speed of losing weight may reduce, but the body shape would be tighter.

### Second Stage

Mainly on strength training, 6 day cycle on all parts of the body.
Add cardio when I am happy :)

## Diet

### First Stage

ByteDance offered light meal with nutrition facts label,
three different types for each meal (lunch and dinner) for free,
which was my major foo source.
For breakfast, I ate protein bar and hot Americano (don't add sugar and milk)
since I didn't want to wake up early.

For details of the light meal, see [the first picture of this post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/134611506). Just keep in mind, don't use any of their sauce.

Cheat meal once a week, choice are
  * hotpot, no sauce
  * BBQ, reduce salt as possible
  * any fish dish

### Second Stage

Oatmeal with berries for breakfast.
For the meals, freedom is provided:
* basic form
  * 300 g vegetable + fruit
  * 200 g meat
  * 150 g carbo
* vegetable
  * cucumber, romaine hearts, celery, tomatoes, carrots (those I ate raw)
  * mushrooms, bok choy, broccoli, asparagus (cooked)
  * apple, banana, graph (after training)
  * berry (with oatmeal)
* meat
  * ribeye, short ribs, New York steak, sirloin
  * salmon, tilapia, shrimp, lobster tail,
  * Chicken Breast

Cheat meal once a week, eat whatever I want.

**NOTE**.
the purpose of cheat meal is to reduce desire of unhealthy food to prevent giving up,
there is no scientific reason that it can actually help metabolism.
