One to highlight mysterious: dada tuo da (8min) 

To make contrast between destruction/explosion: a peaceful sound



sound from inside v.s. sound from outside

* where does the sound came from?
* where is Tetsuo?

* Diegetic Sound â€” from within the movie
* Non-Diegetic Sound â€” from outside the movie
    * almost like tetuso is a higher power/force
    * music

chanting sound during the march

## Narrative \& Storyline.

> think about narrative story line, is there one?

The simplest one is Keneda trying to help Tesuto and rebuild their friendship.

> how is the medium the message? what does it actually do? think about how/what the media (sound) do to the story, narrative, story? who is Akira?

Akira might be the medium of the story, carrying out the plot and underlying idea.
Akira, as from the movie, could be the god, the world saver, a disease, nuclear power,
or just a general form of power that gives privilege or superior to some people.
