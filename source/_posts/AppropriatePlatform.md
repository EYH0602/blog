## ?

Now that we have spent some time with musicals and various themes, do you think that musical theater is an appropriate platform for expressing these topics? Why?

## Ha

I think musical theater is an appropriate platform for expressing these topics. In fact, I think every form of art should express some ideological ideas, especially those involves words. The world is not Utopia, so people will have emotion, attitude, and their own understanding of what's going on. Once we get emotions, we have to express it. Obvious, art is a suitable carrier for them. Musicals, as a presentation form of sound, is easier to be passed to people than visual art with the advance in analog technology (of course, digital now). Even if some people cannot see the performance at first, I will still be interested in musicals.
