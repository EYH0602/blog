# What is the difference between construction of concepts and analysis of concepts?

Construction of concepts and analysis of concepts are two ideas derived from Kant's idea of concepts,
corresponding to mathematics and philosophy.
They are two different to reason about concepts.

## Relationship between Subject and Predicates

To reason about concepts, we use the language of "Subjects is Predicate."
Synthetic a-posteriori is where predicate is not contained in the subject and get added by experience.
For example, "All bodies are heavy",
where the predicate "heavy" is based on experience.
On the other hand,
analytic, a-priori is where predicate is contained in the subject before experience by reason.
For example, "All bachelors are unmarried",
where the predicate "unmarried" is the meaning of the subject "bachelors".
And other permutations of synthetic a-priori and analytic a-priori is allowed.
Then, as defined above,
synthetic a-priori judgement is a sentence that
the predicate is not contained in the subject,
but is a condition for the possibility of experience the subject.

From the above, we can see that the idea of concepts lies between subjects and predicates.
Philosophers analysis the relationship between concepts in terms of subjects and predicates.
Whereas viewing mathematics as synthetic a-priori,
to construct concepts, subjects and predicates can be brought together by either intuition of time of space.
For example, with the intuition of time,
we can start with a moment and get the next moment, its successor, from it,
which results in the concepts of arithmetics.
On the other hand, with the intuition of space,
we can start with a point, and form a line with the points.
Then the lines can form figures, which results in the concepts of geometry.
