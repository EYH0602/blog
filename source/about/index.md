# About Me

Greetings! My name is 贺一峰 (He, Yifeng).
I am an undergrad student at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu),
double major in Applied Math and Computer Science.
I'm also a incoming Ph. D. student at UC Davis starting Fall 2023,
supervised by [Prof. Hao Chen](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/).
My current study interests are Program Analysis, static analysis based on type theory/functional paradigms
and dynamic analysis on fuzzing and property-based testing,
and their application on/for LLM code understanding.
Currently, I am the president of [HackerHub](https://hackerhub-ucdavis.github.io/)(UCDavis Club).

<!-- Apart from academics, my interests cover more topics.
I am a gamer. My favorite games are Pokemon(s), The Witcher 3, Monster Hunter, Clash of Clans, and Genshin Impact.
I also love music (from an audiophile perspective) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ethan0he1/)! -->
