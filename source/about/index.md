# About Me

Hey there! I'm 贺一峰 (He, Yifeng), a third-year Ph.D. candidate at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu).
My advisor is Professor [Hao Chen](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/).
I got my B.S. (with Honors) from UC Davis too,
double majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science.
During undergrad, I also served as president of [HackerHub](https://hackerhub-ucdavis.github.io/),
a student-run tech club on campus.

These days, I spend most of my time thinking about how AI and software engineering can help each other out.
More specifically, my research interests are:

- using AI to improve software engineering, with focus on testing and security,
- making AI itself more secure — both foundation models and agents,
- building better AI models for software engineering,
- safe and secure programming languages (bonus points if useful for AI).
  - PS: useful PL for AI is a very unclear topic, and should be researched on.

I'm also into video games.
Some of my all-time favorites include Pokémon (recently played Sword 🙃, Violet, and Arceus 😊),
The Witcher 3,
Clash of Clans (hit world rank #169 back in April 2018!),
and Genshin Impact (though I haven’t touched it since 4.4, thanks miHoYo 😅).
Other games I've enjoyed or recommend:
The Legend of Zelda series,
Palworld (was obsessed for a while… then drifted back to egg hatching in Pokémon).

<!-- and [Whimel Academy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377250/Whimel_Academy/). -->

<!-- I also love music (from an audiophile perspective) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ethan0he1/)! -->

I also enjoy powerlifting.
I have trained for a little over two years.
My (training) personal records are Squat 405lb (184kg), Bench Press 245lb (111kg), Deadlift 455lb (206kg)
summing up to 1105lb (501kg) @ 85kg body weight.
I also dabble in photography.
