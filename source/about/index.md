# About Me

Greetings! My name is 贺一峰 (He, Yifeng).
I am an undergrad student at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu),
double major in Applied Math and Computer Science.
My current study interests are Functional programming, Language Theory, and Machine learning/Deep learning and their mixed applications.
Currently, I am the president of [HackerHub](https://hackerhub-ucdavis.github.io/)(UCDavis Club).

Apart from academics, my interests cover more topics.
I am a gamer. My favorite games are The Witcher 3, Monster Hunter, and Clash of Clans.
**Genshin Impact** is a really good game available on mobile, PC, and PS platform.
I recommend all of you visiting this page to try it!
I am definitely a Linux lover and a Vimer!
I also love music (from an audiophile perspective) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ethan0he1/)!
Photography in games is also a force that pushed me to look into computer graphics simulating a "real world".
