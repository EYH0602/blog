# About Me

Greetings! My name is 贺一峰 (He, Yifeng).
I am a second year Ph.D. student at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu).
My advisor is Professor [Hao Chen](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/).
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree (with Honors) from UC Davis,
double majored in Applied Math and Computer Science.
During undergrad, I was the president of [HackerHub](https://hackerhub-ucdavis.github.io/)(UCDavis Club).
My current study interests are artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE).
My research topics include AI for SE, SE for AI, SE for (AI for SE).
For AI, my main research topic is (large) language model.
For SE, my main research topics are security, software testing/verification/analysis, and (safe/secured/functional) programming languages. 

<!-- Apart from academics, my interests cover more topics. -->
I like video games. My favorite games are Pokemon (recently: Sword :(, Violet, and Arceus:)), 
The Witcher 3, Clash of Clans (World top #169 in April 2018!), 
and Genshin Impact (haven't play much since 4.4, I blame miHoYo for this).
I also like cozy-style role-playing games like Whimel Academy to reset my mind after research, experiments, and paper writing..
<!-- I also love music (from an audiophile perspective) and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ethan0he1/)! -->
I also enjoy powerlifting.
I have trained for a little over two years.
My (training) personal records are Squat 405lb (184kg), Bench Press 245lb (111kg), Deadlift 455lb (206kg)
summing up to 1105lb (501kg) @ 85kg body weight.
